With the 26th [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) coming up, I took a brief interlude from working on [Pocket Dogfights](http://www.pocketdogfights.com) to work on a small game for the [warmup weekend](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/04/17/warmup-weekend-ludum-dare-26/).

The result of most of a Sunday afternoon was [Space Arena]({{ root_url }}/games/space-arena/index.html) - my own little take on an arena shooter without the twin stick controls. Although it's less polished than I had planned (no audio, no real animations for feedback), I'm still reasonably proud of the results. At least since it's the first **fresh** project I have worked on since I started the original Pocket Dogfights prototypes back in 2011.

I'm tempted to revisit this at some stage, at least depending on how I go for time - so I'm certainly interested in feedback from anyone who has checked it out.
