With 33% of the year behind us (at least in Australia so far), it's inadvertantly become the first part of **Conference Season**.

Over the next month and a bit, there's two big ones I'll be attending (and rightfully looking forward to).

First off, there's [**One More Thing**](http://onemorething.com.au) on May 24. For those who haven't heard of it, it's a conference aimed at the stories behind independent developers on iOS, rather than the technical aspects of the platform.

It's always great hearing those stories - and being able to help refuel one's own sense of passion with one's own projects - which for me has come at the right time, post release of [Pocket Dogfights](http://www.pocketdogfights.com) in particular.

After that, it's a short break, before a trip to the US for Apple's own [WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc). I was *shocked* at successfully being able to get a ticket this time round. I've previously been in 2009, right as I was starting out with doing iOS development - in fact it was during that trip that the earliest parts of [Eventbook](http://eventbook.zerobyt.es) were originally put together ;)

As a counterpoint to the developer stories & passions behind OMT, WWDC is purely about getting access to the latest technologies on both the Macintosh &amp; iOS platforms. Whilst I've been more focused on the latter, I'm tending to look back to the Mac at least regarding a potential project I'm looking at.

Besides being connected to the metaphorical *firehose*, it's also a chance to catch up with friends both in &amp; outside of the development scene, as well as take a small break (being the first time in quite a while I've had the space to organise a real trip anywhere).

Certainly looking forward to all of it - and hopefully I'll be inspired for some new projects afterwards. It does however mean that any further update work to PD might be delayed - as I'd like to have some questions for the labs come WWDC time :)
