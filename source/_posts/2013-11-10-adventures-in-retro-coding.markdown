I had the opportunity to check out [Syntax Party](http://www.syntaxparty.org) yesterday - one of the few demo parties in Australia, and actually the first such party I've ever been to.

Growing up with the C64, I was only tangentially exposed to the [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) via the occasional demo being highlighted in various magazines. Most of the folks I knew growing up were only into the games side of things - and whilst the demo scene grew out of the cracking/piracy of commerical games, it's most certainly transcended that to become it's own unique cultural item.

<!-- more -->

So, when surrounded by lots of retro coders, what could one do but join in the fun? I could have poked about with some coding on iOS, but there's definitely more *layers* getting something working there effects wise. So, I decided to go the retro path &amp; fire up the trusty C64 emulator & start trying to re-teach myself some trusty 6502 assembly language. Besides, it's how one gets the best speed out of the trusty C64 - and it's laughable BASIC implementation isn't the most fun to program with when you actually want to do anything involving graphics &amp; sound ;)

In the end, it was kind of a wash - it's been 15 or so years since I actually wrote 6502 code, and back then I never got that serious with it (as it primarily a distraction prior to getting serious with my CompSci degree) - it's been interesting to even have a poke around with something incredibly primitive by comparison. Also try (and fail) to get my head around trying to do 16-bit mathematics on an 8-bit processor.

Good times. Good times indeed. Whilst I was doing the old fashioned way (as much as I could) - using the 6510+ Assembler running on a C64 emulator, I think if I was going to go further, I'd be focusing on trying to it with a cross-development environment. It might have been fun typing out assembly listings on the C64 itself, but to be honest, after getting use to high resolution displays, I much prefer them for coding. Being able to comment code correctly, or even use labels (which is quite important when coding assembly language) on a text screen 40 characters wide was a bit of a dampener to my productivity ;)

Still, I think it did result in a bit of a bug being hit, and I certainly want to go back to do some more C64 coding when I have some bandwidth available, which depending on how things go, will likely be once I've finished up &amp; released [Pivotus](http://www.pivotusgame.com) onto the world.
