Just a quick post to announce that after a few little hiccups, the Macintosh version of [Pocket Dogfights](http://www.pocketdogfights.com) is now out on the Mac App Store. I'm quite happy with the result, primarily with the retooling of the control scheme (supporting the mouse directly over a touch-style scheme, as well as both Xbox 360 &amp; PS3 controllers), and sharing leaderboards over Game Center with the iOS version.

If you're interested, you can grab it from the [Mac App Store](http://appstore.com/mac/pocketdogfights).

Besides that, there's a small sale for both the [iOS](http://appstore.com/pocketdogfights) &amp; [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.zerobyt.PocketDogfights) versions which will be ending in a couple of days - certainly a great chance to grab it if you've not already.

As always, if you're digging the game - I'd really love it if you could take the time to go and leave a review :)
