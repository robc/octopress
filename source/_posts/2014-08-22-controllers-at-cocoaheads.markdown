Just a bit of a quick post, but last week I had the opportunity to present at [Melbourne Cocoaheads](http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com) on the **GameController** framework which is part of iOS and Mac OS X.

<!-- more -->

The talk was primarily aimed to be an introduction to the frameworks and how they're used in native iOS/Mac applications, as well as details on the available form-factors for the controllers. In addition to those, there were a couple of demos, though one of those happened to suffer a few technical difficulties on the night (as Murphy's Law would indicate).

Thankfully, for those that weren't there - the video is now live for you to watch, which should be embedded below, or you can view it [here](http://vimeo.com/104047493f) if it's not.

In addition - for those using [Unity 3D](http://www.unity3d.com), you can find details about how controllers are mapped for iOS games from the following [blog post](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2013/10/11/unity-4-2-2-brings-ios-game-controller-support/).
