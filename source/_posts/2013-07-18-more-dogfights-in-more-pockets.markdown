Yet another quick post - this time to celebrate **[Pocket Dogfights](http://www.pocketdogfights.com) v1.1.0** going live, along with a couple of surprises!

<!-- more -->

The main purpose of this update was to throw in a few extra bits &amp; pieces, as well as extend the gameplay a tad.

If you've not already seen it - the trailer for the update is embedded below:

If you're unable to watch that (being at work/etc) - the tl;dr version is as follows:

*  Added in the **P-51** as a alternate flyable aircraft.
*  Added two new power up weapons: **Rapid Fire** &amp; **Spread Fire**
*  Added the ability to pick which level you wish to start from (from any you've previously reached)

I've also tweaked things a bit for performance (which I hope helps iPhone 4/iPod touch 4th gen/iPad owners).

With that out of the way - a few more bits &amp; pieces! To celebrate this update along with **PAX Australia**, the price for the iOS, OS X App Store &amp; Android will be dropped to **$0.99** (or equivalent) for the weekend!

In addition, after a long time working out a viable way to sell it, I'm happy to also announce that Pocket Dogfights is now available for PC's running **Windows** & **Linux**. It's available in a **Pay-What-You-Want** ($1 minimum), **DRM Free** bundle along with a standalone OS X version. You can grab it via Gumroad from this link: [http://gum.co/pocketdogfights](http://gum.co/pocketdogfights).

Finally, if you're going to be around at PAX shout out! I still have a bunch of the [stickers](http://instagram.com/p/ZjaQUqlLBl/) left over, and I'd love to get them out there :)
