When *resurrecting* this blog a few months ago, I swore to myself I'd try to avoid posting rants as much as possible. I guess I could only pull that off for so long, but, sometimes, the need arises to make a rant or so :)

In this case: **Passion**. Or the place of one's passion in the wider scheme of things.

For me, that of course is about project development - games, applications &amp; other things. For obvious reasons, the last few months has been more games focused, as I released [Pocket Dogfights](http://www.pocketdogfights.com), and worked on the messaging and support of the game. Considering that for most of this time, the game was my **primary** source of income - it shouldn't be unreasonable for me to have been pushing it as hard as I did :)

Which does beg me to ask - does that sound reasonable to you? It's one thing if you're not into gaming (which I won't hold any hard feelings against), but if you have an honest to goodness problem with me being passionate about this - then I have to say that I feel like you're part of the problem.

There's some 7 *billion* of us on this planet. We're all going to be passionate about different fields, about different interests. Providing one's passions are in a field that isn't making the world worse, then there's no need to get worked up over them!

Finding yourself annoyed by someone posting about their passions which don't interest you? Maybe time to take Wheaton's Law into effect &amp; Don't Be A Dick about it.

Just something small which might help make the world just a little bit nicer, and remove just a little bit of negativity - and if we can do that bit, by bit - maybe the world will be just that bit better off.
