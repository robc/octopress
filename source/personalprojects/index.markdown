### Personal Projects ###

#### [Pocket Dogfights](http://www.pocketdogfights.com) (Unity, C#) ####

Pocket Dogfights is a Windows/Macintosh/Linux/iOS/Android arcade game, in which the player takes the role of a WWII fighter-pilot and must battle waves of enemy fighters and bombers in an attempt to get the highest score.

I handled coding, gameplay design, sound effects design, and some art elements such as power up graphics, and particle effects.

#### [Meteor Swarm](http://meteorswarm.zeroybyt.es) (XNA, C#) ####

Meteor Swarm is a Windows retro-inspired action game combining simple gameplay, fast-paced action, and the thrill of getting the highest score on the high-score table.

#### [Eventbook](http://eventbook.zerobyt.es) (Cocoa Touch, Objective-C) ####

Eventbook was an iOS application designed as a means to easily access your Facebook event feed, as well as pull up a map containing the location of an event - this was well before Facebook's own application supported such facilities.
