The idea of this page is to provide two things at a quick glance. The first is a list of things I am *currently* working on. That can be new projects, or that can be updates to an existing game or application. Obviously, these are things which I own, or am in a position to disclose publically :)

The other item is to provide an overall *softography* of all the projects I've created &amp; published as an individual. Primarily, works I've built for other people don't count, as they tend to be projects which I don't have active ownership in :)

<br />

### Current Projects ###

*  **[Pivotus](http://www.pivotusgame.com)** - a minimalistic, rotational arcade-action game based upon (and heavily extended from) *Onslaught in Space*. Still early in development, and the target platforms are still to be confirmed.

*  **[Pocket Dogfights](http://www.pocketdogfights.com)** - a fast-paced game of arcade aerial combat. Currently out on iOS, Android &amp; Macintosh (via Mac App Store), with other platforms possibily in the pipeline.

Written for a small informal group event.
