**Space Arena** is a small proof of concept I put together as a bit of a weekend thing, and is also part of the [LD26 Warmup Weekend](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/04/17/warmup-weekend-ludum-dare-26/).

The idea came from something knocking about in my head in wanting to do an arena-style shooter without the traditional dual stick controls - primarily as a means to get it running on a touch screen device.

There's not much of a game here, but as a proof of concept, I feel like I certainly want to run with it at a later stage.

The controls are basically driven by mouse. Move the mouse about to set your direction, hold the **left** mouse button down to apply thrust, and the **right** mouse button to fire.

**Notes**
I've not tested the Windows or Linux versions at this time, so there's a chance they might have issues. Also, I've made sure the Mac version has been signed for GateKeeper - so you shouldn't have any issues there.
